In short, he argues that you can’t launder money if you’re not using it.

It would stand to reason that if Ulbricht did not break anti-money laundering laws, they didn’t either. The two allegedly sold more than $1 million in bitcoin to Silk Road users. Selling assets isn’t money laundering. The defense also brings up the wisdom of keeping money laundering laws on the books in the first place.
